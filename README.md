# Triage Priority Prediction (KTAS)

## Problem
Predict patient care priority (Emergency vs Non-Emergency) using only initial triage information.

## Target
Binary KTAS (1-3 = Emergency, 4-5 = Non-Emergency).

## Objective
Minimize under-triage by maximizing recall for Emergency cases.

## Scope
Decision support for prioritization; not diagnosis or treatment.
